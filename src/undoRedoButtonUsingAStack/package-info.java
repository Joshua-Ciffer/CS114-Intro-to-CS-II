/**
 * Add code to the start method to set up the initial board position (look it up online).
 * 
 * Add code to compute the flips when the user places a piece and create a move object that stores the move. For now, you don't need to store move objects in a stack,
 * just create one move object with the move made.
 * 
 * Execute the flips on the gameboard. You can do this by calling the drawImage() method in a loop.
 * 
 * Later we may look at how to create a nicer effect by cascading the flips like falling dominoes, but this is a bit trickier in JavaFX as we would use an AnimationTimer
 * or Timeline
